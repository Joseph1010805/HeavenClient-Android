"""Give every quest its dialogue back, out of the game's own data.

Cosmic ships 708 NPC scripts and FOUR of them are below id 3000, so Maple
Island and Lith Harbor - the first two hours of the game - are silent. Every
quest giver there answers with a log line: "NPC Pio (10000) is not coded".

The words were never missing. `Quest.nx/Say.img` holds the full conversation
for 2800 quests: what the giver says, the accept and decline replies, what
they say when you hand it in, and what they say when you have not finished.
Nothing reads it - Cosmic has no reference to Say.img anywhere.

This writes one `scripts/quest/<id>.js` per quest that has dialogue and does
not already have a hand-written script, in the shape Cosmic's quest scripts
already take. That means no Java conversation engine to write and no new
packets: the generated scripts ride the same machinery the 253 existing ones
do, which is machinery already known to work.

    python tools/gen_quest_scripts.py <Quest.nx> <cosmic>/scripts/quest [--force]

NEVER overwrites an existing script. The hand-written ones do things no
generator can - Roger's quest hurts you and hands you an apple - and a
generated file that only says the words would be a downgrade.
